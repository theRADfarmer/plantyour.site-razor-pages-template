# Site CSS
This directory contains custom CSS files for the project. 

## Using Custom CSS
If you plan to use custom CSS, strip all elements of the default Bootstrap classes and comment out the marked lines in the `_Layout.cshtml` file.

## Using Bootstrap/Tailwind
If you plan to use Bootstrap or Tailwind, you can delete all files in this directory except the `site.css` and `CSS.md` file. 
In the `site.css` file, there are further instructions.
Tailwind.css will need to be installed if you want to use it.
